#!upstart
#
# An example upstart script for running a Node.js process as a service
# using Forever as the process monitor. For more configuration options
# associated with Forever, see: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever
#
# You will need to set the environment variables noted below to conform to
# your use case, and should change the description.

# This line is needed so that Upstart reports the pid of the Node.js process
# started by Forever rather than Forever's pid.

# The following environment variables must be set so as to define
# where Node.js and Forever binaries and the Node.js source code
# can be found.
#
# The example environment variables below assume that Node.js is 
# installed into /home/node/local/node by building from source as outlined 
# here:

#
# It should be easy enough to adapt to the paths to be appropriate to a 
# package installation, but note that the packages available for Ubuntu in
# the default repositories are far behind the times. Most users will be 
# building from source to get a more recent Node.js version.

    # the application fails immediately on launch. This is generally necessary to

    # production servers the same way if a database or other critical service

    # runs under Forever must have a different start file name, regardless of
    # which directory it is in.
