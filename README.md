## Updating Virtual Box Guest Additions

The packaged vagrant box from Ubuntu contains outdated Virtual Box Guest Additions.  Most of the time this shouldn't be a problem, but if you want to update them I recommend this procedure:

1. Install the [vagrant-vbguest plugin](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest): `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
1. Boot the vm without provisioning: `vagrant up --no-provision`
1. Login with `vagrant ssh` and run `sudo apt-get -y -q purge virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11`
1. Logout and `vagrant halt`
1. `vagrant up`
